# Euro 2024 winner predictor

The goal of this project is to predict the winner of the 2024 Euro. 

The code is in the jupyter notebook [final_project.ipynb](final_project.ipynb). 
There are four types of simulations, two for the 2024 tournament and two for the 2020 tournament. 
With and without friendly matches for both tournaments.

The [data](data) directory contains the datasets we used to train our model. 
In the end we used only the [results.csv](data/results.csv) file.

The [Graphs](Graphs) directory contains our resulting graphs for 1'000 iterations of each simulation.
For example, the [Friendly_first.png](Graphs/Friendly_first.png) is the graph we obtained for 2024 tournament using the friendly matches in the training.
